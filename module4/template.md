# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?

chess

What do you know about?


What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

there are big datasets of chessgames online. My idea is to examine the center 16 squares of chessgames after move 15 for example. 
I want to design code that will evaluate what control each player has over these 16 central squares and assign it a value. With that value and the info which player has won I could train a machine learning model to predict which -  given the position of the board at move 15 - player is going to win.

I actually dont know if this model would yield good predictions. But even finding out that this does not serve as a good predictor would be interesting.

A more advcanced and also maybe more precise version of the above project would be: To evaluate the score after move 15 and 25 and to take into account both scores and the relative change between the two.
